\cenquote{``His twisted words entice the weak.\\The price is paid.\\The power is mine!''}{-- Ravenous Demon, Archdemon of Greed}

You are the leader of the abyss. You thrive on the chaos around you and encourage it on every level. The great Onyx has summoned you to this place to discuss the fate of monsters versus humans—the truth is that you don’t really care. You love that the monsters are all in a tizzy about this whole ``gun'' device the humans have crafted. While everyone is all running about like a headless kobold, you are sitting back and chuckling at their screams; when things get hairy all you have to do is blink into the Abyss. You have made it your goal to get as involved in everyone's lives as possible; you absolutely love the rush you feel when you have pulled the wool over someone’s eyes or have manipulated them into throwing their livelihoods away for a few pennies. You keep a tight network of demons, devils, ghosts, and other monsters that deal in information or subterfuge; as the leader of the demons, you keep only the most loyal sources of information. You know little tidbits about everyone here; you need to be aware of potential military invasion as well as knowing how you can sneak your way into hearing more rumors. In your book, treasures are only topped by gossip and gossip is only topped by using that gossip to anonymously sabotage their plans.

In addition to souls, you tend to barter in ritual supplies. You are one of the few demons with knowledge of the most obscure magicks and are absolutely the topmost in guaranteed quality. If you are dealing with someone with no soul to give and no interest in magic, you make them hunt down a new legendary sword for your legendary sword collection; swords hold the spirits of their owners and their triumphs and you love feeling the energies inside them. Of the things you keep to trade, you have mountains of treasure. Someone always wants something, right? Upon receiving the letter from \cOnyx{} the Great Black Dragon, you quickly determine who might be there at that soirée: \cSphinx{} will undoubtably be there. You also think that \cRed{} and \cVampire{} should be there, as leaders of the two oldest monster organizations in Astyria. You also have reason to believe that the other leaders of the council should be there, most likely even the lowyly Goblin leader. You pack some things they may like; a quill for that troll poet, a lovely sparkling necklace for that tree fae (you know that \cTreeFae{\they} have a rare fruit known to allow nocturnal creatures receive no harm form walking in the sun, maybe you can use it to manipulate the Loremasters?). You decide to bring your standard pack of ritual ingredients as well, maybe some subterfuge will be going on. Oh, who are you kidding, monsters are always full of ulterior motives and you always love to manipulate them!

You never miss a chance to offer a deal and you always haggle until you are sure to get what you want. Everyone knows you; not everyone loves you---in fact, most monsters and humans you interact with dislike you, but they always come back for more obscure knowledge or artifacts! You know that stuffy old black dragon has a beautiful masterpiece, the \iSwordofIce{}, in \cOnyx{\their} possession but if only you could come up with something \cOnyx{\they} wants it would be yours! In addition, you have been searching for the missing pieces of the Vorpal Sword of Wonder for centuries now and you have reason to suspect that the scaly grump has one somewhere. One of your dimwitted imps was able to convey that one of the other council members holds a second fragment, but you were unable to understand where. You incinerated the imp on the spot for his incompetence. 

You try to know as much gossip about everyone as possible but information trades are seldom worth it unless you are getting more than just a rumor—your information is valuable so your victims should cough up more than just ``Sally stabbed the king.'' It is your job to convince everyone that you are a loyal friend and then play with them; manipulating those around you is the only way you really feel joy anymore. You rub you claws together and give a wry chuckle. You know that \cRed{} has been spouting an idea of killing all humans for decades now, ever since \cRed{\their} mother was slain by one. Undoubtably, this issue will come up. You have know idea what else might happen at this meeting, but if rituals are being performed, you will be there to supply them (for a sizeable price, of course!) This meeting will be full of chaos because you will ensure it with every fiber of your being. You grab your pack. ``Goodbye, my imps! I must away and help decide the fate of the humans!’’ you shout to no one in particular. ``You’re in charge,’’ you casually say as you pass a statue of yourself and get ready to teleport to \cOnyx{}’s castle.

  \contact{\cVampire{}} A powerful vampire rivaling with \cLich{}
  \contact{\cLich{}} Once a powerful human sorcerer, now an even more powerful lich.
	\contact{\cTreeFae{}} A fae thoroughly infatuated with nature. Capricious and fickle, \cTreeFae{\they} is never boring.
	\contact{\cBabyFae{}} A fae thoroughly infatuated with drinking the dreams of human babies. You appreciate the mischievousness of the fae.
	\contact{\cTroll{}} A troll. \cTroll{\They} seems to have some intense belief that \cTroll{\they} has a talent for poetry. You disagree but find it highly amusing how much the status quo is disrupted by \cTroll{\their} antics.
	\contact{\cWizard{}} You never paid too much attention to the leader of the Djinni because \cWizard{\they} never seem to want to participate in your deals. What a shame!
	\contact{\cCleric{}} You heard that the Ogre hoard had been swarmed by humans but apparently they are hardier than they look! An impressive feat!
	\contact{\cBasilisk{}} Hmm...You heard that the Basilisk has a secret about the power of \cBasilisk{\their} stone gaze. Maybe you could find a cure somewhere?
	\contact{\cMinotaur{}} The minotaur. \cMinotaur{\Their} manner of speak reminds you of your imp minions back home. How quaint. You know of a longstanding intellectual rivalry between \cMinotaur{\they} and \cSphinx{}.
	\contact{\cSphinx{}} Speaking of \cSphinx{}, you always were amused by \cSphinx{}'s ability to play with the minds of others. You love chaos, but you can't stand the cryptic sentences from \cSphinx{\them}; you keep your distance but with sincere respect.
	\contact{\cGoblin{}} This plucky little goblin wants to rule the world someday! You have no faith that \cGoblin{} will succeed in this endeavor, but if you can convince  \cGoblin{\them} to trade away all of \cGoblin{\their} life savings for the cause you will.
	\contact{\cEnt{}} The ent is the oldest and wisest of his forest. He is known for having disdain for undead but seems to be generally peaceful.
