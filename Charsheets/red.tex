		Finally! They've finally recognized your greatness. Ever since your father left, you've had to fight all your life for respect, all because of that accursed name he gave you: ``Ruby." You hate your father, and you've sworn an oath to kill him. Whenever you'd introduce yourself, some guy would laugh and you'd have to bust his head. This constant fighting made you the roughest, toughest dragon in the entire southern Dragon kingdom. You fought your way through the ranks of the army and became the youngest war leader that the southern Dragon kingdom's ever seen. The only dragon more fierce than you is said to be giant black dragon, \cOnyx{} who called this council. Now, \cOnyx{\they}'s finally recognized how great you are by inviting you to this council and asking you for your army. He must be weak, if he's asking for help against the pathetic humans. No human has ever set foot in the southern kingdom, thanks to your stalwart army. You are undoubtedly the most powerful dragon in Astyria, but you want to prove it to everyone. If you send your force, you demand to be the supreme commander, as you're the best here.  With you in command, you will kill all those pathetic humans.
		
In addition, you're the leader of the power society. You want more members, as your power grows. Perhaps you can enlist some of your society's members to raid the \cOnyx{}'s treasure room and find some powerful artifacts. You've heard rumors of a sword that has the power to slay \cOnyx{} and an Orb of Power. Then you'll show everyone who's the most powerful dragon. 

You have heard that fragments of a mighty sword are hidden throughout Onyx's throne room. If you could find all parts you could reforge it into a mighty weapon.
