It has been about 587 years that you have been wandering this plane, perfecting your craft. You were born a wealthy child in Tordin; from your first word, ``dead'' you have seemed most in tune with the thin line separating heartbeats from silence. You often make a point to remember your past, you would lose all semblance of humanity if you didn't. Understanding the human mentality is the key to anticipating them. When you reminisce, you never allow yourself to think too much about your rival, that over-pompous, detestable \cVampire{\full}. The two of you have never gotten along. Your rivalry was born as you two were; your families hated each other with a passion and the two of you maintained tradition. You and \cVampire{\full} have been at war for centuries; if you are able to ensure that \cVampire{\their} troops are deployed, you can then avoid committing your own. In the chaos of war, you shall be able to finally take over the land controlled by \cVampire{\them} while \cVampire{\they} is off fighting. What you are more sure of than anything is that you cannot let the humans get any stronger. You are pleased that \cOnyx{} has called the council to discuss this because no army can fight off the humans alone.

Unfortunately, your strategy of remembering hasn't been working out too well. The living humans seem to be able to overpower your minions in a one-to-one battle unarmed. To your great displeasure, you witnessed a hired mercenary destroy three of your strongest minions using that blasted new contraption they have.

What your nonexistent heart yearns for is the power of raising beasts to do your bidding as well as human corpses. You've played with this fantasy for a while now but haven't made any progress. When you noticed the humans in the village near your secluded home in a musty castle had begun making more and more of those loud destruction machines, you realized you needed to work. Thus far, you have made strong strides in improving your plans for what you know will be the height of your career. You poured over every book you could find, but all your research led to a plateau when several texts referenced a single book with the secret of capturing monster souls. When you attempted to piece together the missing information, you were somewhat successful in that you now are thoroughly versed in raising weak monsters, e.g. goblins, dire rats, etc.  


\begin{itemz}[Goals]
  \item Learn how to raise powerful monsters.
  \item Raise \cOnyx{}.
  \item Protect Phylactery.
  \item You want to kill the humans. Corpses are beautiful and you need to rule them.
  \item Acquire the legendary \iSwordofIce{} to slay \cOnyx{}.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
  \contact{\cOnyx{}} The elder dragon leading the council.
  \contact{\cDemon{}} A powerful demon known for dealing in information.
  \contact{\cVampire{}} A rival ruler of the undead faction. \cVampire{\Their} ideas are vastly inferior. Perhaps \cVampire{\full}'s only useful quality is that \cVampire{\they} is the proud leader of the \bLoremasters{}.
	\contact{\cEnt{}} One of the oldest monsters in the land. \cEnt{\full} has let \cEnt{\their} distaste for you be well-known.
