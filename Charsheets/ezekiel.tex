\name{\cEzekiel{}}

After drinking that potion, you fall unconscious with a splitting headache. When you awaken, the headache is gone but there is now an additional voice in your head. Your previous personality is still very much present, but you are now also Ezekiel, the 1000 year old lord of what are now known as the old fae, back before the fae split into the Summer and Winter Courts. You are confident, powerful, and a natural leader. You expect everyone to follow your orders as a matter of course.

Ezekiel's personality does not conflict with your own --- his considerable experience in combat and magic only adds to your existing power. Your CR is permanently increased by 10.

Ezekiel is 1000 years behind on his history, so the first thing he wants to do is find \cTreeFae{} and \cBabyFae{} to get an update on the status of the fae population and how he came to be awakened. He considers all fae to be his subjects, no matter how much time has passed, and will look after their interests.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
  \item Find out how you came to be here, and what is going on with the fae in the present day.
  \item Protect the interests of the fae.
\end{itemz}
