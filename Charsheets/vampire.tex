\bigquote{``Remember my friend, that knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker''}{-- Bram Stoker, Dracula}

Many throughout the five hundred and eighty seven years of your life have come to hate you and fear the name \cVampire{\full}, of course the fools' petty emotions just make you laugh. They can scream and shout at you all they want -- you are too busy plotting and building knowledge to care. If there is one thing you have learned in all of your long life it is that knowledge is power and you have a lot of knowledge rivaled only by the likes of \cDemon{} and \cOnyx{}. 

Your lust for knowledge is why you founded the \bLoremasters{}. As its leader you can guide the others members on your quest to gain further knowledge. Of course one piece of knowledge you seek and value above all others: knowledge of walking again in the sun. You have heard that the Fae may possess this knowledge, and it will be yours.   

You were born in the human city of Tordin; growing up things where perfectly acceptable other than the fact that everyone around you was a complete moron, or they would have been if it was not for that bastard \cLich{}. You and that dried up shriveled old \cLich{} go way back, back even before you came back to life. You were both rich and you now realize arrogant with the entitlement of privileged youth. You have since learned to remain calm though that fool \cLich{} surely tries your patience, but \cLich{\they} will get \cLich{\their} comeuppance when you take the lands that should rightfully be yours. Your strategy is simple, but foolproof. The plan is wait and let \cLich{} mobilize \cLich{\their} army, losing most of \cLich{\their} disgusting zombies fighting the human hordes. Meanwhile, you and your armies will stay back and seize \cLich{\their} land, leaving \cLich{\them} a homeless beggar -- a most delectable punishment. Of course if things look too grim and you are forced to mobilize your armies to prevent extinction, then you had better be the supreme commander of the armies. You will only agree to mobilize if \cLich{} troops are on the front line too; it is all those zombies are good for anyway.   

You have never liked zombies; they give you and your brood of vampires a bad name. To be bunched under the family of the undead with creatures such as them is completely revolting. They rot and drool where as you are the epitome of style and control. People call vampirism a curse, but it is a blessing, immortality and power. A blessing with one small cost, blood, you cannot let the blood dry up. As such the complete annihilation of the humans cannot be allowed. Enslavement of the human cattle is a beautiful solution. It would be an endless blood bank of waiting and willing slaves. You know of a ritual that has the power to enslave all humans on the continent, if such a thing were true it would be very interesting academically and practically. 

One more thing, \cOnyx{} has entrusted you with being in charge of the dinner party. Make sure everyone shows up and is polite, decorum must be maintained.
