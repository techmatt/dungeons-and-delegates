\cenquote{We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately. -Ben Franklin}

	The world as you know it has ended. Once, monsters ruled the land, and the humans were nothing but a pesky thorn in your side as you battled for dominance among the great leaders of the other monsters. You are an ancient dragon, wise even beyond your formidable years. You recognized that the world was about to change when the smell of black powder first reached your nostrils. Whereas before, the world was in a deadlock with humans doing all they could to not be overwhelmed by monsters and all you had to worry about were a few pesky adventurers who might get the drop on you, now entire human armies march, laying waste to monster kingdoms. Already they have eliminated your good friend, the king of the Manticores, and driven his people to extinction. They have steadily pushed back the forces of the monsters, slowly, but surely, heralding the extinction of your kind. 
	
	However, monsters have never truly united like the humans have. Sure, the trolls and the ogres might have formed an alliance against the (write in race after map creation), but that would always quickly fall to pieces once they ``discussed" how to divide up the lands they had just conquered. Monsters have never presented a united front against humanity, even when it is the humans who pose the greatest threat. 
	
	This is why you have called this council. You have foreseen that the only way to drive back the humans is to unite together, to stop all the infighting amongst the monsters and mobilize your armies to combat the human horde which is desending upon your lands.  
	
	In addition to getting an alliance formed, you  know that an army must have one supreme leader, not just many different equal leaders, or it will inevitably be defeated. Therefore, there will be a vote for the supreme leader of the monster force. You are impartial to whom it is, but they must be wise, level headed, and have their number one goal as the preservation of monsters. If no one else steps forward, you are willing to nominate yourself.
	
	However, you know that some monsters have been approached by human diplomats with offers of peace. You have not received one, as you try to make it a policy to eat every human you see on sight, but if the humans offer of peace is genuine, you would be willing to accept it. Your main goal is the preservation of all the races of monsters, and that this council is successful in its goal of doing just that.
	
	As the caller of this council, you are expected to remain neutral to all parties, and protect their delagates.
	
	You are jealous of your items of immense power in your treasure room, as they have taken you many years to collect, and you know many people desire to steal them. You will only let someone into your treasure room for a very good reason, only accompanied by you.
	
	In your age, you have become a bit lonely, and would like some company. You have heard about magical constructs, and one of them could provide you with the company you desire.
	
	You have three wards in your castle to keep out wizards and other magical beings who often attempt to teleport in without invitation. You need to keep them maintained.
	
	
	\begin{itemz}[Goals]
  \item Make sure the council reaches a decision: War or Peace.
	\item Keep the peace; if a delegate dies before sending  his army, that army will not be sent.
	\item Find a way to make a golem for company.
	\item Keep people out of your treasure room.
	\item Maintain your wards.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
  \contact{\cLich{}} That Lich is looking at you strangely, almost covetously. Youâ€™d better keep an eye on him.
	\contact{\cRed{}} The Red Dragon looks familiar, like a son you once knew. You left him and his mother because you had a kingdom to attend to, and it has been your policy not to interfere in the lives of your children so they can prove their own worth. You gave him the name ``Ruby," knowing that the teasing he went through would toughen him up for the trials of the world, and it looked like it worked. However, now is not the time for a family reunion, as everyone needs to be focused on the matter of the human army approaching. Besides, he's made a name for himself without you as you wanted. He doesn't need another complication in his life.
