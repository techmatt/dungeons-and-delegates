You are the God of War.  You revel in gory chaos. You have been summoned to this place by a ritual performed by one of your followers, a cleric of yours masquerading as an Ogre. You want to see the moat of this castle  run red with blood, the walls painted with the innards of every living thing here. However, you'd much prefer it if the combat was done by the pawns themselves, instead of you ruthlessly slaughtering everyone here. To that end, you have a special ability, the bloodlust you can inspire in any creature.
