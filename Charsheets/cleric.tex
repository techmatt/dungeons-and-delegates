\cenquote{This is a war universe. War all the time. That is its nature.-William S. Burroughs}

	You are a human cleric of the God of War, Groznak. After bushwhacking an ogre delegation, you've arrived at this council of monsters disguised as an Ogre with one goal: Summon your god and kill everyone. You can't wait to see the floors of this castle painted red with blood, the walls smeared with entrails, and the screams of the dying echoing down the corridors once you summon your god. However, the rest of your compatriots failed to teleport into this castle along with you, so you're the only cleric of the god of war here. In addition, you seem to have lost a crucial piece to the ritual: your Holy Book. In order to perform the ritual, you have to find that book. Without any backup, you know that if you're exposed as a human you will be swiftly killed by all the monsters here. After all, it is a council about going to war with the humans.
		
	Hmm, that gives you an idea. It's a council of war, and you worship the god of war. Maybe some creatures here would like to help you with your ritual. You need four more members present for the ritual. If you stretch the truth a bit, claim that the God of War will help them against the humans; maybe you can get some suckers to help you summon your god. As a cleric of the God of War, you may pick up his Holy Book and Sacrificial Dagger. You have been properly ordained, and thus the wards that prevent them from being picked up by other creatures do not effect you.
	
	Until you get more followers, you need to keep your disguise. Stay safe; try to act like you think an Ogre would. There might be some monsters who knew the Ogre you are disguised as. Try and fit into the council, and gain followers. Also, you should try to sabotage the teleportation runes that you teleported in through to prevent anyone from leaving.
	
	In order to help insure your safety, you brought along a gun, a new development by the artificers in your kingdom.  Try to keep it secret, as using it will tip off the other players that you might be a human.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
  \item Keep your disguise up.
