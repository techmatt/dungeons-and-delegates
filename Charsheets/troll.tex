\bigquote{``I'm coming to gobble you up''}{-- Three Billy Goats Gruff}


A Poet and a troll. Two incongruous demons raging in the bowels of your essence. A monster whose wit is sharper than any gnashing teeth it may possess. They call you a fool and laugh, but their laughter is the cage of stenotype trapping them in the fruitless grip of damning expectation. They pity you for the determination you possess, but you in turn pity them for their tinted view of the world that lives in the dream of their visions, haunting their lives. The shades of past shape present. 

Yet the dove does not sing for the song alone, but sings to attract a mate and join in a duet, voices mingling in a cacophony of profound noise. In that regard a magical quill is needed to capture and enthrall, enhancing the soft musing of your heart. A quill of magic to carry the magic of your words to the world, what more fitting magic could there be? In the hands of the dark prince of demonic danger \cDemon{} the quill lies, what task pure or vile will be needed to free the magical key to your poetic whimsy? 

Yet whimsy has taken over more than your dreams, it fills your heart and to the brim, ever since you met her. \cTreeFae{}, \cTreeFae{\their} name itself is the melody of the winds, the song of the trees, and music of the cackling fire. Like a sun rising over tranquil oceans stirred to fury by sudden storms shattering all peaceful facades, your calm vibrant heart was struck by the righteous fury of love that seeped thought every pore of you large frame. An ally, unexpected but well met, has told you of a chance to win her. A metamorphosis most extreme to twist the teeming human masses into tall trees.

Dark clouds gather and the peril rears its dark head, the Djinni \cWizard{} has entrapped you love's shinning heart in his web of treachery. He must die or be dealt with so that the waves may part and love may again see the surface of the beautiful sky of true love. If that bloody declaration does not convince \cTreeFae{} of the validity of your love then you shall have to seek a love potion somewhere. Just a splash on skin of your beloved and away will flutter any lingering doubt of your love. 

\cBabyFae{} the fae, the pale shadow of their cousin \cTreeFae{} may have magic to change shape to make yourself truly ideal in outward form to match the glorious luminosity of your soul. It would help you understand the true beauty of your soul and so the magic must be stolen by whatever means necessary. You must take the tear of magic to gain this vibrant power of shifting shapes. The other ridiculed creature may aid you in your quest for the power, for in it lies a tempting pinnacle of achievement. 

Your army is strong and you really do not care what happens to your soldiers. They are all silly brutes who do not grasp the endless power of your nimble mind. You even have had to smash some of the foolish brutes from time to time. Perhaps you can use your army to garner fortunes favor.
