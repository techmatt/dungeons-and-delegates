The ritual of mass human to tree conversion invented by wizards long ago. It is a ritual to magically convert many humans into trees. It can only be preformed when the sun is highest in the sky thirty minutes before game end.

First eight people must gather and stand in a circle in the ritual chamber within the dungeon

Second the ritual wand stored in the dungeon is required and must be held by the person leading the ritual
