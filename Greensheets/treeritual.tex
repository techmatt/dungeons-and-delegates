\name{\gTreeRitual{}}
The ritual of mass human to tree conversion invented by wizards long ago. It is a ritual to magically convert many humans into trees. It can only be performed when the sun is highest in the sky, during the {\bf last thirty minutes of game.} Be warned that every step of a ritual is interruptible via normal interruption mechanics (ie: a character says ``I stop you'' from within 1 ZoC.)

The ritual has five steps: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Eight people must gather and stand in a circle in the ritual chamber within the dungeon.
\item \iRitualWand{} is required and must be held by the person leading the ritual.
\item The ritual leader must chant ``mundus senescit'' after which, the other seven people participating in the ritual must chant: ``tree to tree''. Repeat this 9 more times for a total of 10 incantations.
\itme Place the \iNatureIdol{} in the center of the circle.
\item Destroy the ritual wand (tear the item card up).
\end{enumerate}

Congratulations! Go tell a GM.
