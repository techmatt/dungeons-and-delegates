The ritual of mass murder invented by wizards long ago. It is a ritual to magically poison many humans. It can only be preformed when the sun is highest in the sky thirty minutes before game end.

This ritual can only be preformed 30 minutes or less until game end.

The ritual has five steps: 

First eight people must gather and stand in a circle in the ritual chamber within the dungeon

Second the ritual wand stored in the dungeon is required and must be held by the person leading the ritual

Third the ritual leader must chant: mors omnibus, ten times after each mors omnibus the other six people must chant: death to death

Fourth the \iReaperIdol{} must be placed in the centre of the circle 

Fifth destroy and consume the ritual wand

Congradulations go get a GM
