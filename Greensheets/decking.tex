\name{\gDecking{}}


If a ritual or abillity requires you to ''deck a hand of strength N'', what you will do is use a deck of cards to
perform the following algorithm.

Note: any task in this game that requires decking can only be attempted by one person at a time.

\begin{enum}[Algorithm]
  \item If you are starting from a full deck, shuffle your cards six times.
  \item Deal out six cards.
  \item Choose up to two cards to keep and discard the rest.
  \item Deal your hand up to six.
  \item Discard all cards in your hand and return to step 2.  If there are fewer than 6 cards left in your deck, return to step 1 instead.
\end{enum}

During steps 2 or 4, check your hand and see if you have a hand of {\bf strength N or greater}, where hand strength is declared below. To over-emphasize dramatically, if a ritual calls for a hand of strength N, a hand of strength over N still works. 

If you have the hand you need, you may end the algorithm and declare success.

Should you run out of cards without finding the hand you need, check the ritual to see if this counts as failing or if you may begin again.
