You are a proud member of the Power Society. The society has had a longstanding tradition of only accepting the best of those monsters who have proven themselves worthy. Once a member commits to joining, there is no abandoning the Society. This society is run by a hierarchy system: new members are ``Minions'' intermediate members are ``Fledglings'' longtime members are ``Warriors'', officers are ``Generals'', and the leader is known as the ``Master''. Currently, the Master is \cRed{} who has fought many battles to protect \cRed{\their} title. Many believe \cRed{} will take the Power Society to heights of influence unforeseen!

{\bf Ritual for New Member Induction}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Two members of rank Fledgling or higher must be present.
\item The two members spar until one is dealt a wound. This wound is non-lethal; the loser suffers a -1CR for 60 seconds, after which they will heal. 
\item The spilt blood is fed to the new member and they gain induction into the Power Society.
\item The ritual is complete after the Minion member joins the two more powerful members in the chant:\\ ``For blood, for power, for glory!\\For treasure, and for fame!\\For blood, for power, for glory!\\The world trembles at our name!''
\end{enumerate}
