The ritual of mass mind control invented by wizards long ago. It is a ritual to magically mind control many humans. It can only be preformed when the sun is highest in the sky thirty minutes before game end.

First eight people must gather and stand in a circle in the ritual chamber within the dungeon

Second the ritual wand stored in the dungeon is required and must be held by the person leading the ritual

Third the ritual leader must chant: mens agitat molem, ten times after each mens agitat molem the other six people must chant: mind to mind
