\name{\gnewmemberlore{}}

You are a proud member of the Loremasters Guild. The Guild is always searching for new members to aid in the trying quest to discover all there is to know in the universe. The leader of the Guild, \cVampire{}, is very finicky about research projects, new members, and the extent to which members dedicate themselves, but \cVampire{\they} is well tolerated because \cVampire{\their} results cannot be argued with. 

Ritual for New Member Induction
1.	Two members of the Loremasters Guild must be present.
2.	The two members sit silently while the potential member discusses his/her research in great detail without stopping for the two members to discuss their own research.
3.	Once the new member has dominated the discussion, each individual must shake hands with each other individual.
4.	The ritual is complete after the chant:

\cenquote{``Though my quill is forever dry,\\My pages forever full,\\Together, as one, we will discover\\The extent of the universe.''}

(Rhyming is for children.)
