How to steal an item from somebody. \emph{Each character can use this ability at most 3 times per game, so choose your targets wisely!}

\begin{enum}[Requirements]
	\item You must have this Greensheet.
	\item You must have two stickers.
	\item You be able to name an item that your mark has which is one hand bulky or less.
\end{enum}

\begin{enum}[Directions]
	\item Choose your mark.
	\item Put two stickers on them without them noticing (can be spread out over any length of time). If anyone notices you putting the sticker on, you must tell them that you are attempting to steal an item from them.
	\item Once the stickering has been accomplished, go tell a GM.
	\item You must be able to name a specific item that you want to steal. Not ``an herb'' or ``a weapon'' but specifically ``One Bleeding Heart'' or ``A Rope.''
	\item The GM will fetch the item for you. If the player does not have that specific item, you will not get anything.
	\item Enjoy your ill-gotten gains!
