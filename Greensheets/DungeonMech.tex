\section{Dungeon Mechanics}
These are instructions on how the Dungeon works, and what to to in them.

\begin{enum}[Directions]
	\item If you are here, you are about to decend into the dungeon. When you enter the dungeon, you will be confronted by choices on the sign. Do what the sign tells you. There are some signs that may improve or decrease your CR. Keep track of this, as there are some signs with CR challenges. You must either match or beat the CR listed as a group to overcome the challenge. Otherwise, you must do what the sign tells you to do. If a sign says "`You may go to sign x or sign y"', go to the corresponding sign. You may only go to the previous sign if the current sign specifies. If you are reduced to 0 CR in the dungeon, you are expelled from the dungeon and cannot return to the dungeon for 30 minutes. All negative CR effects go away once you leave the dungeon.
