\section{Dungeon Mechanics}
These are instructions on how to interact with the Dungeon mechanic.

\begin{enum}[Directions]
	\item If you are reading this page then you are about to descend into the dungeon. You may choose to enter the dungeon alone, or with a group. If you enter with a group, you may split the group at any juncture that presents itself, or form a group with anyone else at the same location as you in the dungeon.
	\item If you choose to enter the dungeon, start at the sign labeled ``Page 1''. The mechanic is similar to a ``choose your own adventure'' book. 
	\item There are some pages that may improve or decrease your CR. Keep track of these changes, as other pages may have  CR challenges. You must either match or beat the CR listed as an individual or a group to overcome the challenge. Otherwise, you must do what the page tells you to do as a ``failed'' challenge. 
	\item If a page says ``You may go to page x or page y'', move to the corresponding sign. You may only return to the previous page if the current page says you may. If you are reduced to 0 CR in the dungeon, you are immediately expelled from the dungeon and cannot return to the dungeon for 30 minutes. 
	\item All negative effects (CR or otherwise) go away once you leave the dungeon.
