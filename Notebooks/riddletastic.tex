\begin{page}{first}
Numbers. Numbers. So many numbers are floating around your head! You need to find the best riddle, but how can you with so many numbers in your head?

Turn the page when two monsters correctly answer one of your riddles.
\end{page}

\begin{page}{second}
Always seeming cryptic and incomprehensible is vital to maintaining your status. Turn the page when you have gotten at least three other creatures to hold hands with you in a circle (players may pretend to hold hands if you are not comfortable with physical contact) and then walk clockwise around that circle for 30 seconds, then counter-clockwise for 30 seconds.
\end{page}

\begin{page}{third}
You often use monsters against themselves to find the perfect riddle -- turn the page when you have gotten at least 2 monsters to tell you new riddles you feel are of at least passable quality.
\end{page}

\begin{page}{fourth}
Yes! This is it! Now you must go and place two \iBilberries{} and four \iEyebright{} into a cauldron. Stir for 60 seconds while incanting your riddle: ``What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs in the evening?'' (A human)

\end{page}

\begin{page}{fifth}
Mmm a perfect potion. The first person to drink it (which could be you, if you so desire) gets +5CR (see a GM.)
