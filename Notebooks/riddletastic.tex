Numbers. Numbers. So many numbers are floating around your head! You need to find the best riddle, but how can you with so many numbers in your head? 

Turn the page when someone correctly answers one of your riddles.
\end{page}

\begin{page}{second}
What is the essence of existence? What is life? What is life to a monster? What is life to a human? If only a human were here. But you feel as if one of the creatures around you is a human in disguise. Which one? Ask ``What is the meaning of breathing to a dove?'' until you gain an answer that only a human can speak!

Turn the page when someone speaks for over 60 seconds in response to your question.
\end{page}
\begin{page}{third}
Now it is time that is driving you mad! What can you do to alleviate this mental soup that plagues your mind? Maybe you need to work this out through movement. 

Turn the page when you have gotten three other creatures to form a square with you and recite prime numbers for at least three minutes. 

\end{page}
\begin{page}{fourth}
Numbers! Humans! Time! You have no idea where this riddle will come about! That dance was useless. You need inspiration! 

Turn the page when you have spoken to every other creature for inspiration.
\end{page}
\begin{page}{fifth}
Ah! yes! Maybe that is the answer. You must go spend ten minutes alone, crafting this riddle to defeat the Minotaur!

Turn the page after you have done this.
\end{page}
\begin{page}{sixth}
Yes! This is it! Now you must go and place Bilberriesx2 and eyebrightx4 into a cauldron. Stir for 60 seconds while incanting your riddle: ``What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs in the evening?''

After you have created this potion, you must force it downt he throat of that blasted minotaur! But you know that \cMinotaur{} will never cooperate whilst conscious! Afterwards, turn the page.
\end{page}

\begin{page}{seventh}
After the potion has been poured down the throat of the knocked out minotaur, the minotaur must answer the riddle. The Minotaur suffers a -5CR penalty until the riddle is solved. 
Congratulations.
