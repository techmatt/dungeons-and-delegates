\begin{page}{first}
``You wish to speak the common language of the peopel and monsters. How do you do so? Perhaps you need to listen to their vernacular?'' you thknk to yourself. You intend to pose the question ``What have you done the day before yesterday's tomorrow's tommorrow?'' to every creature you see.

Turn the page when you recieve a proper answer to your question.
\end{page}

\begin{page}{second}
Hm. That was quaint. Are you sure you want this? Yes. Yes you are. Listening isn't your style, though it did help a little. Maybe you need to read one of their books?

Turn the page when you find a ``common'' book and read it.
\end{page}

\begin{page}{third}
Well, that was only a little bit helpful. Maybe you need a spell? Or a wish? Yes, a wish!

Turn the page after you have seen the Djinni about your wish.
\end{page}

\begin{page}{fourth}
Well, that was unfortunate. Maybe the potion idea was right, afterall? You think that you would know how to make a potion about this, but it seems that knowledge is beyond you! That demon or that old dragon might know something.

Turn the page after you have looked into this potio idea?
\end{page}

\begin{page}{fifth}
Yes! A potion exists! But how can you obtain it? Where could it be? You go into a trance and sense that it is near---surrounded by stone?

Turn the page after you have obtained the potion.
\end{page}

\begin{page}{sixth}
Wow. What a long journey it has been to obtain this potion! Now you will hopefully gain what you desire! You drink the potion and gain the ability to speak in simple mundane phrases. Congratulations?
