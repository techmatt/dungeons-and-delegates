The Tear of Magic is a repository of fairy magic. It is not the source of the fairies magic, it is however a concentrated to dose of fairy magic. If consumed it can grant some semblance of fairy magic, if a non-fairy player consumes the Tear of Magic they should immediately go find a DM. Almost all fairies keep a tear of magic on their persons for emergencies. As such the fae guard their Tears if Magic jealously.
