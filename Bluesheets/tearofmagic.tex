The Tear of Magic is a repository of fairy magic. It is not the source of the fairies magic, it is however a concentrated dose of fairy magic. If consumed, it can grant some semblance of fairy magic. 

Most fairies carry a Tear with them because it is occasionally useful. It has limited benefit to the fairy themselves (\emph{Fairy characters cannot consume the Tear of Magic - it wouldn't do the fairy any good anyway as the Tear can convey no additional magics to what you have. This is a kludge for game balance.}) but can be traded away for the right favor. Since fairy magic is capable of many unique feats, even among monsters, a Tear is a very valuable commodity indeed and should not be traded away lightly.
