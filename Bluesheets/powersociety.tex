\cenquote{``A truly strong person does not need the approval of others any more than a lion needs the approval of sheep.''}{-- Vernon Howard}

Monsters have thrived on this continent of Astyria for as long as the two suns have been flying about the sky. Epic battles have been fought with rivers of blood staining the ground. No two species formed alliances, in the beginning. As time ticked on, monsters began seeing the similarities they held and started bonding based on those similarities. Factions of monsters have developed from those with similar interests. Two organizations have made their mark on the land as the two oldest factions; though their age is where their similarities end. One of the two societies are the Power Society, a hardy group of battletorn warriors who have fought their way to immense control over Astyria, both in politics and in brute force. The other society is the Loremasters Guild, a scholarly group of intellectuals who have found a niche as the single most reliable source of information as well as being a unit responsible for nearly all technological advances for the monster world. The Power Society is run by the up and coming visionary known as \cRed{}. The Loremasters Guild is run by the aristocratic and fastidious \cVampire{}.

The Society encourages its members to become as strong as possible. There is no discrimination as long as you can hold your own in a one on one battle. For obvious reasons, no weaklings are allowed to join; those members who work to gain presence in politics are still chosen by their physical prowess as well as mental. Each potential new member must pass a trial to prove their strength before the induction ritual into the Society. You and the strongest of your ancestors have always been members; you passed your trial with flying colors! The values of the Society are manifold, but you appreciate that the direction the Society has taken over the last fifty years has moved towards a more secret influence than in the past. You find the politics, while absolutely not your mug of ale, necessary for lasting power. The Loremasters Guild doesn't seem as if they have any real presence in Astyria because they mostly just shut themselves in the great Astyrian Library and ignore the world. You imagine every Loremasters member must never see the sun because they are always sitting bent over tomes. The Power Society doesn't mean as much to you as it did to your father, but you still participate fully in whatever tasks \cRed{} asks of you. You are a reliable member; you willingly use your strength to further the Society's goals for future generations. . Once a member commits to joining, there is no abandoning the Society. This society is run by a hierarchy system: New members are ``Minionsâ'' Intermediate members are ``Fledglings,'' Longtime members are ``Warriors'', Officers are ``Generalsâ'' and the leader is known as the ``Master''. Currently, the Master is \cRed{} who has fought many battles to protect his title. Many believe \cRed{} will take the Power Society to heights of influence unforeseen!

  \item Acquire as much power and glory as possible!
  \item Keep the Power Society on top of every snivelling weakling.
  \item Gain new members with great power!
