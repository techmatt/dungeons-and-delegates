\cenquote{``Intelligence without ambition is a bird without wings.''}{-- Salvador Dali}


Monsters have thrived on this continent of Astyria for as long as the two suns have been flying about the sky. Epic battles have been fought with rivers of blood staining the ground. No two species formed alliances, in the beginning. As time ticked on, monsters began seeing the similarities they held and started bonding based on those similarities. Factions of monsters have developed from those with similar interests. Two organizations have made their mark on the land as the two oldest factions; though their age is where their similarities end. One of the two societies is the Power Society, a hardy group of battletorn warriors who have fought their way to immense control over Astyria, both in politics and in brute force. The other society is the Loremasters Guild, a scholarly group of intellectuals who have found a niche as the single most reliable source of information as well as being a unit responsible for nearly all technological advances for the monster world. The Power Society is run by the up and coming visionary known as \cRed{}. The Loremasters Guild is run by the aristocratic and fastidious \cVampire{\full}.

You are a proud, faithful member of the Loremasters Guild. You spend hours poring over books, searching for the elusive secrets of the universe. The Guild encourages only the most dedicated scholars to join; members only increase rank when they are publicly witnessed as being martyrs for their research. Many view the members of the Loremasters Guild, as stuffy, dusty, weaklings but that could not be farther from the truth. In fact, the current leader of the Guild is the fastidious \cVampire{\full} who rules the Guild with an iron fist. No research is important or groundbreaking enough for the leader's approval. Though the current leader is strict and arrogant, \cVampire{\they} isn't there to be liked---something that \cVampire{\they} knows very well. You joined because you truly appreciated the combined force of intellectual energy created by the Guild. You know that it takes a lot more than just physical power to ascend to the zenith of mortal living---an achievement you believe rests on the power of knowledge as well as the power of might. The Loremasters Guild rules more of Astyria than the commonwealth believe because without the technology constantly being improved by the Guild, everyone's lives would suffer. Unlike the Power Society, the Loremasters Guild understands that the importance of the group's existence is to further the cause of future generations, not forcing ridiculous tests onto its potential new members.

Any two members can induct a new member by conducting a one minute ceremony. (\emph{Roleplay accordingly.})



\begin{itemz}[Goals]
  \item Acquire as much information about everything forever!

  \item Gain new members with great knowledge.
\end{itemz}

  \member{\cVampire{}} The vampire leader of the Guild. \cVampire{\They} is not very likeable, but the Guild has certainly risen in power since \cVampire{\they} took over.

	\member{\cBabyFae{}} A winter fae who was inducted into the society for providing the group a handful of rare, ancient human wizard books.
	\member{\cSphinx{}} No one in the Loremasters Guild is sure whether or not \cSphinx{} is actually a member as no one has been able to decipher \cSphinx{\their} answer when asked.
